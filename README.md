 <h2>Hi, I'm Conrad, an <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/Josh">IT Professional</a>üéóÔ∏è</h2>
     <p> IT has always been a big dragon breathing down my neck. My exsperience started with computer science where I used what I knew to help others. A year later I slid into keyboarding 101 which put me in the Drafting & Engineering lane. Its been 15 years and now I want to earn back what I felt was my safe hayven. I've reached the ceilin of my previous job and I want to change my outcome.</p>
